# Personal Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for setting up a development environment with:

- **tmux**: Terminal multiplexer with [Oh My Tmux](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux)
- **zsh**: Shell with [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
- **neovim**: Text editor with custom configuration

## üîß Quick Installation

Clone this repository to your home directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfile
```

Run the installer:
